# Code Wars Questions:
 Doing these in Python, hopefully it comes back to me. 
 
 Prompt #1: 
 A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. 
 However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! 
 each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. 
 Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, 
 will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

Code: 
def hero(bullets, dragons): 
  bullets_needed = dragons * 2
  
  if bullest >= bullets_needed:
    return True
   else: 
    return False
    
 Works
 
 
 Prompt #2: 
 Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, 
 return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...".
 Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.
 
 def count_sheep(n):
    result = ""
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result += str(i) + " sheep..."
        
    return result
    
 Works
 
 Prompt #3: 
 Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[True,  True,  True,  False,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  True,  False, True,  False,
  True,  False, False, True ,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  False, False, True,  True]

The correct answer would be 17.

Code: 
def count_sheeps(sheep):
    count = 0
    
    for sheeps in sheep: 
        if sheeps: 
            count += 1
            
    return count
    pass
    
Works
